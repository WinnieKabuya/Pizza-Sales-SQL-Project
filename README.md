# Introduction

Let's talk about why it's so important to look closely at how well our pizzas are selling. By analyzing the sales numbers, we can figure out what's working really well (our best sellers) and what might need some improvement (our not-so-great sellers).  Today, we're not just focusing on what's going great; we're also going to learn from the pizzas that aren't selling as much. This way, we can make smart choices to make all our pizzas even better and more popular.
